	<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.4em;font-style:italic;">If you don't know what a browser is or think &ldquo;The Interweb&rdquo; is the blue icon on your computer, <a href="">CLICK HERE</a></p>
	<p style="font-size:28px;line-height:1.4em;">Hi, your browser here. Look, there's no easy way to say this but, this isn't working out anymore. I'm old, cranky, and hate your filthy standards with every fiber of my being. It's not you, it's me, really. You would be better off with some of my younger, sexier brethren like Firefox, Safari, Chrome or Opera. Safer too. In fact, if you don't move on right now and stick with me, I will infect you with <i>all</i> of the malware. It'll be like sleeping with a Taiwanese hooker after her 15-hour shift doing 3 pounds of mescaline at the same time. You will not feel good afterwards. So save yourself some trouble and part with your shitty browser already.</p>
	<p style="font-size:28px;line-height:1.4em;">What's that you say? You can't install a new browser because you're at your workplace and they don't want you to? Why, install this thing instead : <a href="">Google Chrome Frame</a>. You don't need the IT guys' approval, and it'll change your experience of browsing the internet. Be warned though: it'll probably break your shitty intranet.</p>
