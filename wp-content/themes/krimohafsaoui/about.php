		<h2>Who are you?</h2>
		<p>A web designer &amp; developer based in France. I like to think that I take a no-bullshit approach in how I handle projects as well as clients. I prefer working with decent, reasonable and intelligent people, preferably from all walks of life. I'm uncompromising when it comes to choosing the right type of client and ignoring or firing <a href="http://clientsfromhell.net/">the others</a>. It might sound rough, but it guarantees a solid business relationship while nipping in the bud the horrible ones. As you may thus imagine, I tend to tell things as they are, whether good or bad.</p>
		<p>Regarding my ideal clients, I'd much rather deal with small business owners and individuals than big corporations. While a huge project/challenge is always fun to take on, I prefer getting to know the person and their business and crafting them something special; as opposed to building bulky soulless products.</p>

		<h2>What are your skills?</h2>
		<p>I'm skilled in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign&hellip; But you probably don't care much for all of that technical stuff. So I'm skilled in coming up with solutions to your problems on the web. I'm skilled in establishing long-lasting business relationships.</p>
